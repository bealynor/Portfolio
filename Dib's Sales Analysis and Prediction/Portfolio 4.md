# Portfolio
This repository comprises the necessary files for the Portfolio 4 task assigned in COMP2200/6200 S1 2023. 

# Heart Disease Dataset


The dataset contains the 2020 telephone survey results conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). It includes answers from respondents about their health status such as BMI category, Smoking Status, and their number of Sleeping Hours.


# Objective of the Project

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. Identify association and relationship among variables:
    1. Is there a relationship between Age and Heart Disease?
    2. How do factors such as BMI, Alochol, and Smoking status affect the likelihood of developing heart disease?
    3. Which ethnicity have high chances of getting heart disease?
    4. What is the impact of lifestyle factors such as exercise on the progression of heart disease?
    

2. Predict outcomes by using different predictive modeling techniques:
    1. If given an unknown data, can we predict if that person has heart disease?
    2. How well do the modeling techniques work?
    3. Which among the predictive modeling techniques have the highest accuracy score?
    4. Are there any limitations and biases that we should be aware of?


# Project Tasks
1. Explore the data to understand structures and patterns among variables:
    1. Describing the data
    2. Cleaning the data (removing outliers, filling in missing values, etc.)
    3. Converting categorical variables to numerical format
    4. Conduct data analysis (univariate, bivariate analysis)
    5. Create visualization to better understand the data
2. Perform different regression models to find relationships among variables
3. Build different predictive models
4. Validate the models
4. Provide overall analysis of steps undertaken
