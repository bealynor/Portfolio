# Portfolio
This repository comprises the necessary files for the Portfolio 4 task.

# Heart Disease Dataset


The dataset contains the 2020 telephone survey results conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). It includes answers from respondents about their health status such as BMI category, Smoking Status, and their number of Sleeping Hours.


# Objective of the Project

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. Identify association and relationship among variables
2. Build different predictive modeling techniques
3. Analysing the models and how to improve them

# Project Tasks
1. Explore the data to understand structures and patterns among variables:
    1. Describing the data
    2. Cleaning the data (removing outliers, filling in missing values, etc.)
    3. Converting categorical variables to numerical format
    4. Conduct data analysis (univariate, bivariate analysis)
    5. Create visualization to better understand the data
2. Perform different regression models to find relationships among variables
3. Build different predictive models
4. Validate the models
4. Provide overall analysis of steps undertaken
